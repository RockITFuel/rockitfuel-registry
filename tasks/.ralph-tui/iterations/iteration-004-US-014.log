You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.

Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Let me create a comprehensive analysis document:\n\n## Analysis Report: Block-Related Code Architecture\n\nBased on my thorough investigation of the codebase, here's a comprehensive breakdown of the existing patterns for creating a Blocks section with category tabs:\n\n---\n\n### 1. BlockViewer Component\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/block-viewer.tsx`\n\nThis is a sophisticated component for displaying block code and previews. Key features:\n- **Props:**\n  - `name`: Block name\n  - `registryName`: Name for installation\n  - `files`: Array of BlockFile objects with path and content\n  - `preview?`: JSX element for inline preview\n  - `previewUrl?`: URL for iframe preview\n  - `class?`: Additional styling\n\n- **Features:**\n  - Tabs for Preview/Code views\n  - File tree navigation for multi-file blocks\n  - Language-aware syntax highlighting\n  - Refresh and open-in-new-tab buttons\n  - Install command display\n  - File tree with folder/file icons\n\n- **Architecture:**\n  - Uses `createSignal` for tab state and file selection\n  - `buildFileTree()` function creates hierarchical navigation\n  - `FileTreeNode` component with recursive rendering\n  - Custom icons (refresh, file, folder, folder-open)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Block Registration in Registry\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/registry.json`\n\nBlocks are registered with `type: \"registry:block\"`. Structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"app-sidebar\",\n  \"type\": \"registry:block\",\n  \"title\": \"App Sidebar\",\n  \"description\": \"...\",\n  \"dependencies\": [],\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"src/...\",\n      \"type\": \"registry:lib|registry:component\",\n      \"target\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Existing blocks:**\n- `app-sidebar` - Sidebar navigation system\n- `modular-form` - Form bundle (actually type: registry:modular)\n- `modular-input` - Individual form field\n- `modular-textarea` - Text area field\n- `modular-select` - Select field\n- `modular-searchable-select` - Searchable select\n- `modular-combobox` - Combobox field\n- `modular-date-picker` - Date picker field\n- `modular-checkbox` - Checkbox field\n- `helpers` - Utility components\n\n---\n\n### 3. Existing Tab Implementations\n\n**Tabs Component:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`\n\nBuilt on Kobalte primitives with components:\n- `Tabs` (Root)\n- `TabsList` - Container for triggers\n- `TabsTrigger` - Individual tab button\n- `TabsContent` - Content for each tab\n- `TabsIndicator` - Active state indicator\n\nUsed in BlockViewer:\n```tsx\n<Tabs value={activeTab()} onChange={(value) => setActiveTab(value as \"preview\" | \"code\")}>\n  <TabsList>\n    <TabsTrigger value=\"preview\">Preview</TabsTrigger>\n    <TabsTrigger value=\"code\">Code</TabsTrigger>\n  </TabsList>\n</Tabs>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Routes Structure\n\n**Directory Structure:**\n```\nsrc/routes/(app)/docs/\n├── blocks/\n│   ├── index.tsx           # List of blocks\n│   ├── app-sidebar.tsx\n│   ├── modular-form.tsx\n│   ├── modular-input.tsx\n│   ├── modular-checkbox.tsx\n│   ├── modular-combobox.tsx\n│   ├── modular-date-picker.tsx\n│   ├── modular-searchable-select.tsx\n│   ├── modular-select.tsx\n│   ├── modular-textarea.tsx\n│   └── helpers.tsx\n├── components/\n│   ├── index.tsx           # List of UI components\n│   ├── alert.tsx\n│   ├── button.tsx\n│   ├── ...\n│   └── 32 other components\n├── libraries/\n│   └── index.tsx\n└── getting-started.tsx\n```\n\n**Blocks Index Pattern:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/index.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nconst blocks = [\n  {\n    title: \"App Sidebar\",\n    href: \"/docs/blocks/app-sidebar\",\n    description: \"...\",\n    status: \"new\" as const,\n  },\n  // ... more blocks\n];\n\nexport default function BlocksIndex() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <PageHeader>\n        <PageHeaderHeading>Blocks</PageHeaderHeading>\n        <PageHeaderDescription>...</PageHeaderDescription>\n      </PageHeader>\n\n      <div class=\"grid gap-4\">\n        <For each={blocks}>\n          {(block) => (\n            <A href={block.href}>\n              <div>\n                <span>{block.title}</span>\n                {block.status === \"new\" && <Badge>new</Badge>}\n              </div>\n              <p>{block.description}</p>\n            </A>\n          )}\n        </For>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Block Documentation Page Patterns\n\n**Two patterns exist:**\n\n**Pattern A - App Sidebar (Full Custom):**\nLocation: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/app-sidebar.tsx`\n\nUses custom layout with sections for:\n- Installation command\n- Dependencies chips\n- Included components list\n- Features list\n- Usage code examples\n\n**Pattern B - Modular Components (Consistent Layout):**\nLocation: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/modular-checkbox.tsx`\n\nStructured with sections:\n- Installation (with InstallCommand)\n- Dependencies (with DependencyChips)\n- Usage (with code examples)\n- Props table\n- Examples (multiple code blocks)\n- Related components (links to related pages)\n\n---\n\n### 6. Public Registry JSON Files\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/`\n\nEach component/block has a JSON file with schema: `https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json`\n\nExample structure (`app-sidebar.json`, `complex-component.json`):\n- Metadata (name, type, title, description)\n- Dependencies array\n- Files array with content inline\n\n**Categories file:** `categories.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"rockitfuel-categories\",\n  \"categories\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"components\",\n      \"title\": \"UI Components\",\n      \"description\": \"...\",\n      \"type\": \"registry:ui\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"blocks\",\n      \"title\": \"Blocks\",\n      \"description\": \"Pre-built, composable component blocks\",\n      \"type\": \"registry:block\"\n    },\n    // ... other categories\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. Documentation Configuration\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`\n\nCentralized navigation config with sidebar structure:\n```tsx\nsidebarNav: [\n  {\n    title: \"Blocks\",\n    items: [\n      { title: \"App Sidebar\", href: \"/docs/blocks/app-sidebar\", status: \"new\" },\n      { title: \"Modular Form\", href: \"/docs/blocks/modular-form\", status: \"new\" },\n      { title: \"Modular Input\", href: \"/docs/blocks/modular-input\", status: \"new\" },\n      // ... 9 total block entries\n    ],\n  },\n  // ... other categories\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. Key UI Components Used\n- **PageHeader, PageHeaderHeading, PageHeaderDescription** - Consistent page layout\n- **Badge** - Status indicators (e.g., \"new\")\n- **InstallCommand** - Command display for registry installation\n- **DependencyChips** - Display dependencies as chips\n- **Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent** - Tab navigation\n- **CodeBlock** - Syntax-highlighted code display\n- **For / Show** - Solid.js control flow\n\n---\n\n### 9. Category Structure in Categories.json\n\nThe registry already defines a `blocks` category with:\n- **name:** \"blocks\"\n- **title:** \"Blocks\"\n- **description:** \"Pre-built, composable component blocks for common patterns\"\n- **type:** \"registry:block\"\n\nThis aligns with the routing structure where blocks are under `/docs/blocks/`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Patterns for Creating Blocks Section with Category Tabs:\n\n1. **Main Blocks Index Page** - Grid layout of card links (pattern in `/docs/blocks/index.tsx`)\n2. **Individual Block Pages** - Can use:\n   - Custom layout (app-sidebar style)\n   - Standardized layout with InstallCommand + sections\n3. **Tab Navigation** - Use Kobalte-based Tabs component (already in UI)\n4. **File Organization** - Add new `.tsx` files in `/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/`\n5. **Registry Entry** - Add block definition to `registry.json` with files\n6. **JSON Metadata** - Create corresponding JSON file in `/public/r/`\n7. **Navigation Update** - Add entry to `docs.ts` config\n8. **Category Support** - Categories already defined in `public/r/categories.json`\n\nAll patterns use SolidJS reactivity (createSignal, createMemo, For, Show), Kobalte primitives for accessibility, and consistent shadcn/ui component styling."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a8c27f6 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4d65b0e6-9a62-4549-83ec-1d119950103d","uuid":"ff471a1f-8c6f-4b5d-b901-02427023127f","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Find and analyze the existing block-related code in this project:\n1.

Block Documentation Page Patterns\n\n**Two patterns exist:**\n\n**Pattern A - App Sidebar (Full Custom):**\nLocation: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/app-sidebar.tsx`\n\nUses custom layout with sections for:\n- Installation command\n- Dependencies chips\n- Included components list\n- Features list\n- Usage code examples\n\n**Pattern B - Modular Components (Consistent Layout):**\nLocation: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/modular-checkbox.tsx`\n\nStructured with sections:\n- Installation (with InstallCommand)\n- Dependencies (with DependencyChips)\n- Usage (with code examples)\n- Props table\n- Examples (multiple code blocks)\n- Related components (links to related pages)\n\n---\n\n### 6. Public Registry JSON Files\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/`\n\nEach component/block has a JSON file with schema: `https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json`\n\nExample structure (`app-sidebar.json`, `complex-component.json`):\n- Metadata (name, type, title, description)\n- Dependencies array\n- Files array with content inline\n\n**Categories file:** `categories.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"rockitfuel-categories\",\n  \"categories\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"components\",\n      \"title\": \"UI Components\",\n      \"description\": \"...\",\n      \"type\": \"registry:ui\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"blocks\",\n      \"title\": \"Blocks\",\n      \"description\": \"Pre-built, composable component blocks\",\n      \"type\": \"registry:block\"\n    },\n    // ... other categories\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. Documentation Configuration\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`\n\nCentralized navigation config with sidebar structure:\n```tsx\nsidebarNav: [\n  {\n    title: \"Blocks\",\n    items: [\n      { title: \"App Sidebar\", href: \"/docs/blocks/app-sidebar\", status: \"new\" },\n      { title: \"Modular Form\", href: \"/docs/blocks/modular-form\", status: \"new\" },\n      { title: \"Modular Input\", href: \"/docs/blocks/modular-input\", status: \"new\" },\n      // ... 9 total block entries\n    ],\n  },\n  // ... other categories\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. Key UI Components Used\n- **PageHeader, PageHeaderHeading, PageHeaderDescription** - Consistent page layout\n- **Badge** - Status indicators (e.g., \"new\")\n- **InstallCommand** - Command display for registry installation\n- **DependencyChips** - Display dependencies as chips\n- **Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent** - Tab navigation\n- **CodeBlock** - Syntax-highlighted code display\n- **For / Show** - Solid.js control flow\n\n---\n\n### 9. Category Structure in Categories.json\n\nThe registry already defines a `blocks` category with:\n- **name:** \"blocks\"\n- **title:** \"Blocks\"\n- **description:** \"Pre-built, composable component blocks for common patterns\"\n- **type:** \"registry:block\"\n\nThis aligns with the routing structure where blocks are under `/docs/blocks/`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Patterns for Creating Blocks Section with Category Tabs:\n\n1. **Main Blocks Index Page** - Grid layout of card links (pattern in `/docs/blocks/index.tsx`)\n2. **Individual Block Pages** - Can use:\n   - Custom layout (app-sidebar style)\n   - Standardized layout with InstallCommand + sections\n3. **Tab Navigation** - Use Kobalte-based Tabs component (already in UI)\n4. **File Organization** - Add new `.tsx` files in `/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/`\n5. **Registry Entry** - Add block definition to `registry.json` with files\n6. **JSON Metadata** - Create corresponding JSON file in `/public/r/`\n7. **Navigation Update** - Add entry to `docs.ts` config\n8. **Category Support** - Categories already defined in `public/r/categories.json`\n\nAll patterns use SolidJS reactivity (createSignal, createMemo, For, Show), Kobalte primitives for accessibility, and consistent shadcn/ui component styling."}],"totalDurationMs":859935,"totalTokens":59137,"totalToolUseCount":47,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1489,"cache_read_input_tokens":55225,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1489,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2419,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.

Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Built with bun-only tooling and shadcn-style installation.\n\n**Target Audience:** Internal team initially, transitioning to public open-source registry  \n**Tech Stack:** SolidJS, Bun, D3 (handmade charts), Vinxi, TailwindCSS\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Provide a unified registry for all reusable SolidJS components, hooks, utilities, and libraries\n2. Enable shadcn-style installation via `bunx shadcn@latest add <name>` or URL\n3. Document all registry items with consistent page templates, live demos, and copy-ready code\n4. Rename \"super-*\" components to \"modular-*\" throughout the codebase\n5. Build D3 chart system from scratch with SolidJS integration\n6. Ship as a single milestone with all sections complete\n\n---\n\n## Sections & Features\n\n### A. Global Site Framework\n\n#### A1. Clipboard Utilities\n- Copy buttons on all code blocks, install commands, and \"Copy page URL\"\n- Toast notification on successful copy (using solid-sonner)\n\n#### A2. Prev/Next Navigation\n- Auto-generated from sidebar ordering\n- Displayed at bottom of content pages\n\n#### A3. On-Page Table of Contents\n- Auto-generated from page headings (h2, h3)\n- Scrollspy highlighting for active section\n- Sticky positioning in right sidebar\n\n#### A4. Command Palette Search (⌘K)\n- Client-side fuzzy search across all content (FlexSearch/Fuse.js)\n- Build-time index generation\n- Categories: Components, Modular, Blocks, Charts, Libraries, Functions, Hooks\n\n---\n\n### B. Content System\n\n#### B1. Page Authoring\n- Pure TSX pages with embedded markdown strings (current approach)\n- Frontmatter-equivalent via page metadata exports (title, description, keywords, category)\n\n#### B2. Code Block Component\n- Syntax highlighting (Shiki - already installed)\n- Optional filename header\n- Always-visible copy button\n- Bun-only commands (no package manager tabs)\n\n#### B3. Reusable Page Template\nStandard sections for all registry item pages:\n- Title & description\n- Install command with copy button\n- Dependencies chips (runtime vs dev optional distinction)\n- Usage code snippet(s)\n- Live demo preview (inline, not iframe)\n- Examples (variants/states)\n- Related items links\n\n---\n\n### C. Registry Infrastructure\n\n#### C1. Registry JSON Endpoints\n**Required:**\n- `GET /r/<item>.json` - Individual item (existing pattern in `/public/r/`)\n\n**Index endpoints:**\n- `GET /r/registry.json` - Full registry index (exists)\n- `GET /r/categories.json` - Category listing (to add)\n\n#### C2. Registry Item Schema\nCurrent schema (maintain compatibility):\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json\",\n  \"name\": \"string\",\n  \"type\": \"registry:ui | registry:hook | registry:lib | registry:block | registry:chart | registry:function\",\n  \"title\": \"string\",\n  \"description\": \"string\",\n  \"dependencies\": [\"string\"],\n  \"registryDependencies\": [\"string\"],\n  \"files\": [{ \"path\": \"string\", \"type\": \"string\", \"content\": \"string\" }],\n  \"category\": \"string\",\n  \"keywords\": [\"string\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### C3. Install Commands\nAll documentation uses bun-only:\n- `bunx shadcn@latest init`\n- `bunx shadcn@latest add <name>`\n- `bunx shadcn@latest add <full-url>`\n- `bun add <package>` for npm dependencies\n\n#### C4. Dependency Display\n- Chips/badges for each dependency\n- Link to npm/registry item where applicable\n- Visual distinction between runtime and dev dependencies (optional)\n\n---\n\n### D. Components Section (Base UI Primitives)\n\n#### D1. Component Catalog\nPages for each primitive built on @ark-ui/solid and @kobalte/core:\n- Alert, Avatar, Badge, Breadcrumb, Button\n- Card, Carousel, Checkbox, Collapsible, Color Picker, Combobox, Command\n- Context Menu, Date Picker, Dialog, Dropdown Menu\n- Hover Card, Input, Label, Popover, Progress\n- Select, Separator, Sheet, Skeleton, Switch\n- Table, Tabs, Textarea, Tooltip\n\n#### D2. Component Page Features\n- Live inline demo preview\n- Install command + copy\n- Dependencies chips\n- Usage snippet(s)\n- Examples (variants/states)\n- Related components links\n\n#### D3. Base Libraries\n- Primitives: @ark-ui/solid, @kobalte/core\n- Icons: lucide-solid\n- Animation: solid-motionone\n\n---\n\n### E. Modular Components Section (Form Wrappers)\n\n#### E1. Rename Task\n- Rename all \"super-*\" to \"modular-*\" in:\n  - File names\n  - Component names\n  - Registry items\n  - Documentation\n\n#### E2. Purpose\n- Dedicated section for @modular-forms/solid integrated wrappers\n- Pre-built form field components with validation display, error states","numLines":150,"startLine":1,"totalLines":349}}}

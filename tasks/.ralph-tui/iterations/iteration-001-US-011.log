YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.

Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Now let me create a comprehensive summary with all the file paths and patterns found:\n\n## Summary: Bundle Pages, Form Components, and Docs Structure\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the codebase, here are the key findings:\n\n### 1. **Bundle/Modular Form Structure**\n\n**Key File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/modular-form.tsx`\n\nThis is the model for a \"bundle\" page that groups related form components. Pattern:\n- **PageHeader** component with heading and description\n- **InstallCommand** section showing installation instructions\n- **Dependencies** section listing all dependencies as code blocks\n- **Included Components** section showing a grid of component cards (2-column on mobile, using `sm:grid-cols-2`)\n- **Features** section as a bulleted list\n\n**Registry JSON:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/modular-form.json`\n- Type: `\"registry:modular\"`\n- Contains 16 sub-components with paths like `components/modular-form/modular-*.tsx`\n\n### 2. **Form-Related Components in Registry**\n\nLocated in `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/`:\n- `input.json`\n- `label.json`\n- `textarea.json`\n- `checkbox.json`\n- `modular-form.json` (large bundle with all form fields)\n- `example-form.json`\n\n### 3. **Docs Routes Structure**\n\n**Base:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/`\n\nOrganization:\n- `docs.tsx` - Main docs layout\n- `docs/components/` - Individual component pages (e.g., `button.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `label.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, `checkbox.tsx`, `combobox.tsx`, `date-picker.tsx`)\n- `docs/components/index.tsx` - Components listing page with grid layout\n- `docs/blocks/` - Bundle pages (e.g., `modular-form.tsx`, `app-sidebar.tsx`, `helpers.tsx`)\n- `docs/libraries/` - Library documentation pages\n- `docs/hooks/` - Custom hooks documentation\n- `docs/getting-started.tsx` - Getting started guide\n\n### 4. **Component Page Pattern**\n\n**Core Component:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/component-page.tsx`\n\nProps interface:\n```typescript\ntype ComponentPageProps = {\n  name: string;\n  title: string;\n  description: string;\n  registryName: string;\n  dependencies?: string[];\n  usage?: string;\n  usageLang?: string;\n  examples?: Example[];\n  related?: RelatedItem[];\n  children?: JSX.Element; // Preview section\n};\n```\n\nSections included:\n1. **Title + PageHeader** - Heading, description, copy URL button\n2. **Installation** - `InstallCommand` component with package manager tabs\n3. **Dependencies** - `DependencyChips` component (clickable npm badges)\n4. **Usage** - Optional code block\n5. **Preview** - Optional component demo\n6. **Examples** - Optional array of example sections\n7. **Related** - Optional grid of related component links\n\n### 5. **Key Supporting Components**\n\n**Install Command:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/install-command.tsx`\n- Uses tabbed interface for bun/pnpm/npm/yarn\n- Generates commands from component name\n- Stores user's preferred package manager in localStorage\n- Copy button on each command\n\n**Dependency Chips:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/dependency-chips.tsx`\n- Maps dependencies to npm links\n- Shows dev dependencies with `(dev)` badge\n- Supports both string and object format: `{name: string, dev?: boolean}`\n- Links to npmjs.com\n\n**Page Header:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/page-header.tsx`\n- Composable sections: `PageHeader`, `PageHeaderHeading`, `PageHeaderDescription`, `PageHeaderActions`\n- `CopyPageUrlButton` for sharing pages\n\n### 6. **Example Page Patterns**\n\n**Simple Component (Input/Label/Textarea):**\n```tsx\n<ComponentPage\n  dependencies={[]}\n  description=\"...\"\n  name=\"input\"\n  registryName=\"input\"\n  title=\"Input\"\n>\n  <div class=\"flex w-full max-w-sm flex-col gap-4\">\n    {/* Demo content */}\n  </div>\n</ComponentPage>\n```\n\n**With Related Items (Label/Textarea):**\n```tsx\n<ComponentPage\n  {...props}\n  related={[\n    { title: \"Input\", href: \"/docs/components/input\", description: \"...\" },\n    { title: \"Checkbox\", href: \"/docs/components/checkbox\", description: \"...\" }\n  ]}\n>\n  {/* Demo */}\n</ComponentPage>\n```\n\n**Bundle Page (Modular Form):**\n- No `ComponentPage` wrapper\n- Direct PageHeader composition\n- Custom grid for listing included components\n- Manual dependency display with code elements\n\n### 7. **Registry JSON Structure**\n\n**Standard Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json\",\n  \"name\": \"component-name\",\n  \"type\": \"registry:ui|registry:modular\",\n  \"title\": \"Component Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Component description\",\n  \"dependencies\": [\"@package/name\"],\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"components/ui/component.tsx\",\n      \"type\": \"registry:ui\",\n      \"content\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 8. **Absolute File Paths Summary**\n\n**Component Page Examples:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/button.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/input.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/label.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/textarea.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/checkbox.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/date-picker.tsx`\n\n**Bundle Pages:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/modular-form.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/app-sidebar.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/helpers.tsx`\n\n**Core Components:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/component-page.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/install-command.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/dependency-chips.tsx`\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/page-header.tsx`\n\n**Modular Form Components:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/super-form/modular-*.tsx` (16 components)\n\n**Registry JSON Files:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/` (all component definitions)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ad64c6b (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"087ab321-96ea-4a0b-852a-5b291a1e8e61","uuid":"ba516a8f-28ef-4032-add7-1b34070c7b42","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Find and understand:\n1.

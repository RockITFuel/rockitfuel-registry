YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.

Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"I need more context first\\\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\\n| \\\"Let me explore the codebase first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Now let me create a comprehensive report based on all the information I've gathered:\n\n## Summary Report: Codebase Structure and Patterns\n\nBased on my thorough examination of the codebase, here's what I found:\n\n### 1. **Existing Modular Form Bundle Page**\n\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/blocks/modular-form.tsx`\n\nThis is the main bundle page (not a component-specific page). It demonstrates the pattern for multi-component bundles. Key structure:\n- Uses custom manual layout instead of `ComponentPage` component\n- Imports: `Title`, `A`, `For`, `Show` from Solid.js, plus `DependencyChips`, `InstallCommand`, and `PageHeader*` components\n- Displays:\n  - Installation section with `InstallCommand` component\n  - Dependencies section with `DependencyChips` component\n  - Included Components grid showing all 14+ modular form components with optional links to base components\n  - Usage section with code example\n  - Validation Behavior section (bulleted list)\n  - Features section (bulleted list)\n\n### 2. **Component Documentation Pattern (for individual components)**\n\n**Example Files:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/input.tsx` (minimal)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/textarea.tsx` (with related links)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/button.tsx` (with examples)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/date-picker.tsx` (minimal)\n\n**Pattern:** Uses `ComponentPage` wrapper component with props:\n```typescript\n<ComponentPage\n  name=\"component-name\"               // For metadata\n  title=\"Component Title\"              // Display title\n  description=\"Description text\"       // Page description\n  registryName=\"registry-name\"         // For install commands\n  dependencies={[\"@package/name\"]}     // Optional array of dependencies\n  usage={codeString}                   // Optional usage code\n  usageLang=\"tsx\"                      // Code language (default: \"tsx\")\n  examples={[{title, description, component}]} // Optional examples\n  related={[{title, href, description}]}       // Optional related links\n>\n  {/* Optional preview/children */}\n</ComponentPage>\n```\n\n### 3. **Helper Components Used**\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/install-command.tsx`\n- Shows tabbed installation commands for different package managers (bun, pnpm, npm, yarn)\n- Props: `component: string` (the registry component name)\n- Uses `InstallCommand` component\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/dependency-chips.tsx`\n- Displays dependencies as clickable badge chips linking to npm.com\n- Props: `dependencies: (string | Dependency)[]`, optional `class`\n- Supports marking dependencies as dev dependencies\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/component-page.tsx`\n- Wrapper component that standardizes documentation page layout\n- Renders: Title meta, PageHeader, Installation, Dependencies, Usage code, Preview, Examples, Related sections\n- Uses `CodeBlock` for syntax-highlighted code display\n\n### 4. **Registry Files Structure**\n\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/modular-form.json`\n\n**Current single bundle file containing:**\n- `$schema`: \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json\"\n- `name`: \"modular-form\"\n- `type`: \"registry:modular\"\n- `title`: \"Modular Form\"\n- `description`: Full description of all components included\n- `dependencies`: Array of 6 packages:\n  - @modular-forms/solid\n  - @ark-ui/solid\n  - @internationalized/date\n  - date-fns\n  - solid-motionone\n  - debounce\n- `files`: Array of 16 file objects, each with:\n  - `path`: \"components/modular-form/modular-*.tsx\"\n  - `type`: \"registry:component\"\n  - `content`: Full source code as string\n\n**Modular Components in Registry:**\n1. modular-input.tsx\n2. modular-text-area.tsx\n3. modular-select.tsx\n4. modular-searchable-select.tsx\n5. modular-combobox.tsx\n6. modular-date-picker.tsx\n7. modular-color-picker.tsx\n8. modular-checkbox.tsx\n9. modular-file-input-list.tsx\n10. modular-password-update.tsx\n11. modular-label.tsx\n12. modular-error.tsx\n13. modular-forms-select.tsx\n14. modular-forms-combobox.tsx\n15. modular-forms-toggle-button.tsx\n16. modular-forms-toggle-button-group.tsx\n\n### 5. **File Structure and Naming Conventions**\n\n**Source Components:**\n- Path: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/super-form/` (Note: files still named super-* but referenced as modular-* in registry)\n- Files: Individual `.tsx` files for each component\n- Exports: Named exports, e.g., `export default ModularInput`\n\n**Documentation Pages:**\n- Path: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/`\n- Subdirectories: `/components/`, `/blocks/`, `/libraries/`, `/hooks/`\n- Naming: kebab-case (e.g., `modular-form.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `date-picker.tsx`)\n- Default exports: `function ComponentNamePage()`\n\n**Registry Files:**\n- Path: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/`\n- Naming: kebab-case with `.json` extension\n- Current pattern: Single `modular-form.json` bundling all components\n\n### 6. **Documentation Navigation/Sidebar Configuration**\n\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`\n\nCurrent structure shows:\n- Main navigation tabs: Docs, Components, Blocks, Libraries, Hooks\n- Sidebar categories:\n  - **Getting Started** (1 item)\n  - **UI Components** (31 items - base components)\n  - **Blocks** (3 items including \"Modular Form\")\n  - **Libraries** (3 items)\n  - **Hooks** (3 items)\n\nModular Form is listed as a \"Block\" under the Blocks category with a \"new\" status indicator.\n\n### 7. **Recent Refactoring Context**\n\nCommit `41d9e18` (most recent relevant change):\n- Renamed all `super-*` components to `modular-*`\n- Updated component class names (SuperInput → ModularInput)\n- Updated registry entries (super-form.json → modular-form.json)\n- Updated documentation page references\n\nThe components themselves are still in `/src/components/super-form/` but exported as modular-* in the registry.\n\n### Key Takeaways for Your Use Case:\n\n1. **Single Bundle Approach**: Modular Form is delivered as ONE comprehensive bundle (`modular-form.json`) containing all 16 components, not as individual registry entries\n2. **Documentation Pattern**: The bundle uses a custom page layout (not ComponentPage) with sections for Installation, Dependencies, Included Components, Usage, Validation Behavior, and Features\n3. **Component Reusability**: Helper components (`DependencyChips`, `InstallCommand`) are reused across all documentation pages\n4. **Installation**: Uses standardized `InstallCommand` component that displays commands for multiple package managers\n5. **Dependencies**: Listed once at bundle level; all components share these dependencies\n6. **TypeScript**: Strong type safety with ComponentProps, JSX.Element, and Component types throughout"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: af62c18 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"759eead0-ed76-4cda-ba7d-cc9b00b80db7","uuid":"c5de0c5d-6337-4206-9494-c511e7cc5123","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Find and examine:\n1.

Usage section with code example\n  - Validation Behavior section (bulleted list)\n  - Features section (bulleted list)\n\n### 2. **Component Documentation Pattern (for individual components)**\n\n**Example Files:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/input.tsx` (minimal)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/textarea.tsx` (with related links)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/button.tsx` (with examples)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/components/date-picker.tsx` (minimal)\n\n**Pattern:** Uses `ComponentPage` wrapper component with props:\n```typescript\n<ComponentPage\n  name=\"component-name\"               // For metadata\n  title=\"Component Title\"              // Display title\n  description=\"Description text\"       // Page description\n  registryName=\"registry-name\"         // For install commands\n  dependencies={[\"@package/name\"]}     // Optional array of dependencies\n  usage={codeString}                   // Optional usage code\n  usageLang=\"tsx\"                      // Code language (default: \"tsx\")\n  examples={[{title, description, component}]} // Optional examples\n  related={[{title, href, description}]}       // Optional related links\n>\n  {/* Optional preview/children */}\n</ComponentPage>\n```\n\n### 3. **Helper Components Used**\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/install-command.tsx`\n- Shows tabbed installation commands for different package managers (bun, pnpm, npm, yarn)\n- Props: `component: string` (the registry component name)\n- Uses `InstallCommand` component\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/dependency-chips.tsx`\n- Displays dependencies as clickable badge chips linking to npm.com\n- Props: `dependencies: (string | Dependency)[]`, optional `class`\n- Supports marking dependencies as dev dependencies\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/component-page.tsx`\n- Wrapper component that standardizes documentation page layout\n- Renders: Title meta, PageHeader, Installation, Dependencies, Usage code, Preview, Examples, Related sections\n- Uses `CodeBlock` for syntax-highlighted code display\n\n### 4. **Registry Files Structure**\n\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/modular-form.json`\n\n**Current single bundle file containing:**\n- `$schema`: \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json\"\n- `name`: \"modular-form\"\n- `type`: \"registry:modular\"\n- `title`: \"Modular Form\"\n- `description`: Full description of all components included\n- `dependencies`: Array of 6 packages:\n  - @modular-forms/solid\n  - @ark-ui/solid\n  - @internationalized/date\n  - date-fns\n  - solid-motionone\n  - debounce\n- `files`: Array of 16 file objects, each with:\n  - `path`: \"components/modular-form/modular-*.tsx\"\n  - `type`: \"registry:component\"\n  - `content`: Full source code as string\n\n**Modular Components in Registry:**\n1. modular-input.tsx\n2. modular-text-area.tsx\n3. modular-select.tsx\n4. modular-searchable-select.tsx\n5. modular-combobox.tsx\n6. modular-date-picker.tsx\n7. modular-color-picker.tsx\n8. modular-checkbox.tsx\n9. modular-file-input-list.tsx\n10. modular-password-update.tsx\n11. modular-label.tsx\n12. modular-error.tsx\n13. modular-forms-select.tsx\n14. modular-forms-combobox.tsx\n15. modular-forms-toggle-button.tsx\n16. modular-forms-toggle-button-group.tsx\n\n### 5. **File Structure and Naming Conventions**\n\n**Source Components:**\n- Path: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/super-form/` (Note: files still named super-* but referenced as modular-* in registry)\n- Files: Individual `.tsx` files for each component\n- Exports: Named exports, e.g., `export default ModularInput`\n\n**Documentation Pages:**\n- Path: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs/`\n- Subdirectories: `/components/`, `/blocks/`, `/libraries/`, `/hooks/`\n- Naming: kebab-case (e.g., `modular-form.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `date-picker.tsx`)\n- Default exports: `function ComponentNamePage()`\n\n**Registry Files:**\n- Path: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/public/r/`\n- Naming: kebab-case with `.json` extension\n- Current pattern: Single `modular-form.json` bundling all components\n\n### 6. **Documentation Navigation/Sidebar Configuration**\n\n**Location:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`\n\nCurrent structure shows:\n- Main navigation tabs: Docs, Components, Blocks, Libraries, Hooks\n- Sidebar categories:\n  - **Getting Started** (1 item)\n  - **UI Components** (31 items - base components)\n  - **Blocks** (3 items including \"Modular Form\")\n  - **Libraries** (3 items)\n  - **Hooks** (3 items)\n\nModular Form is listed as a \"Block\" under the Blocks category with a \"new\" status indicator.\n\n### 7. **Recent Refactoring Context**\n\nCommit `41d9e18` (most recent relevant change):\n- Renamed all `super-*` components to `modular-*`\n- Updated component class names (SuperInput → ModularInput)\n- Updated registry entries (super-form.json → modular-form.json)\n- Updated documentation page references\n\nThe components themselves are still in `/src/components/super-form/` but exported as modular-* in the registry.\n\n### Key Takeaways for Your Use Case:\n\n1. **Single Bundle Approach**: Modular Form is delivered as ONE comprehensive bundle (`modular-form.json`) containing all 16 components, not as individual registry entries\n2. **Documentation Pattern**: The bundle uses a custom page layout (not ComponentPage) with sections for Installation, Dependencies, Included Components, Usage, Validation Behavior, and Features\n3. **Component Reusability**: Helper components (`DependencyChips`, `InstallCommand`) are reused across all documentation pages\n4. **Installation**: Uses standardized `InstallCommand` component that displays commands for multiple package managers\n5. **Dependencies**: Listed once at bundle level; all components share these dependencies\n6. **TypeScript**: Strong type safety with ComponentProps, JSX.Element, and Component types throughout"}],"totalDurationMs":1013640,"totalTokens":56249,"totalToolUseCount":41,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1439,"cache_read_input_tokens":52822,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1439,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1982,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

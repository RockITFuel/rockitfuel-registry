For all other skills, use the 'Skill' tool:**\\n\\n---\\nname: using-superpowers\\ndescription: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\\n---\\n\\n<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\nIf you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.\\n\\nIF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\\n\\n```dot\\ndigraph skill_flow {\\n    \\\"User message received\\\" [shape=doublecircle];\\n    \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\" [shape=diamond];\\n    \\\"Invoke Skill tool\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Has checklist?\\\" [shape=diamond];\\n    \\\"Create TodoWrite todo per item\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Follow skill exactly\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Respond (including clarifications)\\\" [shape=doublecircle];\\n\\n    \\\"User message received\\\" -> \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\";\\n    \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\" -> \\\"Invoke Skill tool\\\" [label=\\\"yes, even 1%\\\"];\\n    \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\" -> \\\"Respond (including clarifications)\\\" [label=\\\"definitely not\\\"];\\n    \\\"Invoke Skill tool\\\" -> \\\"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\\\";\\n    \\\"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\\\" -> \\\"Has checklist?\\\";\\n    \\\"Has checklist?\\\" -> \\\"Create TodoWrite todo per item\\\" [label=\\\"yes\\\"];\\n    \\\"Has checklist?\\\" -> \\\"Follow skill exactly\\\" [label=\\\"no\\\"];\\n    \\\"Create TodoWrite todo per item\\\" -> \\\"Follow skill exactly\\\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Red Flags\\n\\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\\n\\n| Thought | Reality |\\n|---------|---------|\\n| \\\"This is just a simple question\\\" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"I need more context first\\\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\\n| \\\"Let me explore the codebase first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project. Let me create a detailed report for you.\n\n## Project Exploration Report: Command Palette Search (Cmd+K) Implementation\n\nI've thoroughly explored your SolidJS documentation site project. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Project Framework & Architecture\n\n**Framework:** SolidStart (SolidJS meta-framework)\n- **Configuration:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/app.config.ts` shows SSR disabled (CSR-only)\n- **Routing:** File-based routing using `@solidjs/router`\n- **Layout Structure:**\n  - `src/routes/(app).tsx` - Main app layout (wraps with Navbar + Footer)\n  - `src/routes/(app)/docs.tsx` - Docs layout with Sidebar + TableOfContents\n  - Docs pages are nested in `src/routes/(app)/docs/` with categories: components, blocks, hooks, libraries\n\n### 2. Docs Configuration\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`\n\nThe configuration defines:\n- **mainNav:** Top navigation items (Docs, Components, Blocks, Libraries)\n- **sidebarNav:** Hierarchical navigation structure with 5 categories:\n  - Getting Started\n  - UI Components (30+ components)\n  - Blocks (3 items with \"new\" status)\n  - Libraries (3 items)\n  - Hooks (3 items)\n\nEach item has: `title`, `href`, optional `status` (\"new\"/\"updated\")\n\n### 3. Existing Search Implementation\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/search.tsx`\n\nGreat news! A command palette search **already exists** and is partially implemented:\n\n**Current Features:**\n- ✅ Cmd/Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut handling (lines 28-39)\n- ✅ CommandDialog integration with cmdk-solid\n- ✅ Searches through all docs config categories\n- ✅ Icon mapping for categories (FileText, Layers, Library, Hash)\n- ✅ Navigation on select using `useNavigate()`\n- ✅ Mobile-responsive button (icon-only on mobile, expanded on desktop)\n- ✅ Keyboard shortcut display: `⌘ K`\n\n**Integration:** SearchButton is already exported and used in Navbar (line 79 of navbar.tsx)\n\n### 4. Component Library & UI Stack\n\n**Package.json Dependencies:**\n- **UI Components:** `@kobalte/core` v0.13.11 (primitives)\n- **Command Palette:** `cmdk-solid` v1.1.2 (command menu component)\n- **Keyboard Handling:** `@solid-primitives/keyboard` v1.3.3\n- **Icons:** `lucide-solid` v0.544.0\n- **Styling:** TailwindCSS + class-variance-authority + clsx + tailwind-merge\n- **Other:** sonner (toasts), embla-carousel, shiki (syntax highlighting)\n\n### 5. Keyboard Shortcut Handling\n\n**Current Implementation in search.tsx:**\n```typescript\nonMount(() => {\n  const down = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {\n    if (e.key === \"k\" && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      setOpen((o) => !o);\n    }\n  };\n  document.addEventListener(\"keydown\", down);\n  onCleanup(() => document.removeEventListener(\"keydown\", down));\n});\n```\n\n**Pattern Used:**\n- Direct addEventListener in onMount/onCleanup\n- Checks both Cmd (macOS) and Ctrl (Windows/Linux)\n- Global listener (not scoped to specific element)\n\n### 6. Command Component Library\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/ui/command.tsx`\n\nWraps `cmdk-solid` library with styled components:\n- `Command` - Root container\n- `CommandDialog` - Dialog wrapper with custom styling\n- `CommandInput` - Search input with magnifying glass icon\n- `CommandList` - Scrollable results (max-h-[300px])\n- `CommandEmpty` - No results state\n- `CommandGroup` - Category grouping\n- `CommandItem` - Individual selectable item\n- `CommandSeparator` - Visual separator\n- `CommandShortcut` - Display keyboard shortcuts\n\n### 7. UI Component Patterns\n\n**Dialog Component** (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`):\n- Uses `@kobalte/core/dialog` primitives\n- Portal-based rendering (fixed positioning)\n- Animated overlay and content\n- Accessible close button\n\n**Button Component** (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`):\n- `@kobalte/core/button` based\n- CVA (class-variance-authority) for variants\n- Supports: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link\n- Sizes: default, sm, lg, icon\n\n**Styling Approach:**\n- TailwindCSS utility classes\n- `cn()` utility function combines clsx + tailwind-merge\n- Consistent spacing, typography, colors\n\n### 8. Navigation Patterns\n\n**Navbar** (`src/components/navbar.tsx`):\n- Uses `@solidjs/router`'s `useLocation()` for active state\n- `<A>` component for client-side navigation\n- SearchButton imported and rendered in top-right\n\n**Sidebar** (`src/components/sidebar.tsx`):\n- Collapsible sections with state persisted to localStorage\n- Expands/collapses when section title clicked\n- \"new\"/\"updated\" badges for items\n- Current page highlighted based on pathname matching\n\n### 9. Additional Utilities\n\n**Helper Hook:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/hooks/use-validated-search-params.ts`\n- Syncs URL search params with validated state (Zod schema)\n- Type-safe parameter handling\n- Could be useful for advanced search features\n\n**Utils:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/lib/utils.ts`\n- `cn()` function: combines clsx + tailwind-merge\n\n---\n\n## Summary for Command Palette Enhancement\n\nYour search implementation is well-structured and ready for enhancement. Here's what's in place:\n\n| Aspect | Status | Details |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| Framework | ✅ SolidStart/SolidJS | SSR disabled, CSR-only |\n| Command Palette UI | ✅ Implemented | cmdk-solid + @kobalte/core |\n| Cmd+K Shortcut | ✅ Implemented | Global keyboard listener |\n| Docs Data Structure | ✅ Configured | Hierarchical nav config |\n| Icon System | ✅ Available | lucide-solid + custom icons |\n| Search Button | ✅ In Navbar | Mobile-responsive |\n| Search Logic | ✅ Basic | Searches via cmdk-solid's value prop |\n\n**Potential Enhancement Areas:**\n- Full-text search of page content (not just titles)\n- Search result highlighting/previews\n- Recently visited pages\n- Keyboard navigation hints (⬆️⬇️ to navigate, Enter to select)\n- Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance\n- Grouping enhancements\n- Search history/favorites\n\nLet me know what specific enhancements you'd like to implement!"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aa0a4cf (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1dbf21c4-8502-4839-bb0a-d8d3f11e378e","uuid":"736174a6-6780-4554-ba5c-934788c93909","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to implement a command palette search (Cmd+K) for a SolidJS documentation site.

Docs Configuration\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`\n\nThe configuration defines:\n- **mainNav:** Top navigation items (Docs, Components, Blocks, Libraries)\n- **sidebarNav:** Hierarchical navigation structure with 5 categories:\n  - Getting Started\n  - UI Components (30+ components)\n  - Blocks (3 items with \"new\" status)\n  - Libraries (3 items)\n  - Hooks (3 items)\n\nEach item has: `title`, `href`, optional `status` (\"new\"/\"updated\")\n\n### 3. Existing Search Implementation\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/search.tsx`\n\nGreat news! A command palette search **already exists** and is partially implemented:\n\n**Current Features:**\n- ✅ Cmd/Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut handling (lines 28-39)\n- ✅ CommandDialog integration with cmdk-solid\n- ✅ Searches through all docs config categories\n- ✅ Icon mapping for categories (FileText, Layers, Library, Hash)\n- ✅ Navigation on select using `useNavigate()`\n- ✅ Mobile-responsive button (icon-only on mobile, expanded on desktop)\n- ✅ Keyboard shortcut display: `⌘ K`\n\n**Integration:** SearchButton is already exported and used in Navbar (line 79 of navbar.tsx)\n\n### 4. Component Library & UI Stack\n\n**Package.json Dependencies:**\n- **UI Components:** `@kobalte/core` v0.13.11 (primitives)\n- **Command Palette:** `cmdk-solid` v1.1.2 (command menu component)\n- **Keyboard Handling:** `@solid-primitives/keyboard` v1.3.3\n- **Icons:** `lucide-solid` v0.544.0\n- **Styling:** TailwindCSS + class-variance-authority + clsx + tailwind-merge\n- **Other:** sonner (toasts), embla-carousel, shiki (syntax highlighting)\n\n### 5. Keyboard Shortcut Handling\n\n**Current Implementation in search.tsx:**\n```typescript\nonMount(() => {\n  const down = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {\n    if (e.key === \"k\" && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      setOpen((o) => !o);\n    }\n  };\n  document.addEventListener(\"keydown\", down);\n  onCleanup(() => document.removeEventListener(\"keydown\", down));\n});\n```\n\n**Pattern Used:**\n- Direct addEventListener in onMount/onCleanup\n- Checks both Cmd (macOS) and Ctrl (Windows/Linux)\n- Global listener (not scoped to specific element)\n\n### 6. Command Component Library\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/ui/command.tsx`\n\nWraps `cmdk-solid` library with styled components:\n- `Command` - Root container\n- `CommandDialog` - Dialog wrapper with custom styling\n- `CommandInput` - Search input with magnifying glass icon\n- `CommandList` - Scrollable results (max-h-[300px])\n- `CommandEmpty` - No results state\n- `CommandGroup` - Category grouping\n- `CommandItem` - Individual selectable item\n- `CommandSeparator` - Visual separator\n- `CommandShortcut` - Display keyboard shortcuts\n\n### 7. UI Component Patterns\n\n**Dialog Component** (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`):\n- Uses `@kobalte/core/dialog` primitives\n- Portal-based rendering (fixed positioning)\n- Animated overlay and content\n- Accessible close button\n\n**Button Component** (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`):\n- `@kobalte/core/button` based\n- CVA (class-variance-authority) for variants\n- Supports: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link\n- Sizes: default, sm, lg, icon\n\n**Styling Approach:**\n- TailwindCSS utility classes\n- `cn()` utility function combines clsx + tailwind-merge\n- Consistent spacing, typography, colors\n\n### 8. Navigation Patterns\n\n**Navbar** (`src/components/navbar.tsx`):\n- Uses `@solidjs/router`'s `useLocation()` for active state\n- `<A>` component for client-side navigation\n- SearchButton imported and rendered in top-right\n\n**Sidebar** (`src/components/sidebar.tsx`):\n- Collapsible sections with state persisted to localStorage\n- Expands/collapses when section title clicked\n- \"new\"/\"updated\" badges for items\n- Current page highlighted based on pathname matching\n\n### 9. Additional Utilities\n\n**Helper Hook:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/hooks/use-validated-search-params.ts`\n- Syncs URL search params with validated state (Zod schema)\n- Type-safe parameter handling\n- Could be useful for advanced search features\n\n**Utils:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/lib/utils.ts`\n- `cn()` function: combines clsx + tailwind-merge\n\n---\n\n## Summary for Command Palette Enhancement\n\nYour search implementation is well-structured and ready for enhancement. Here's what's in place:\n\n| Aspect | Status | Details |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| Framework | ✅ SolidStart/SolidJS | SSR disabled, CSR-only |\n| Command Palette UI | ✅ Implemented | cmdk-solid + @kobalte/core |\n| Cmd+K Shortcut | ✅ Implemented | Global keyboard listener |\n| Docs Data Structure | ✅ Configured | Hierarchical nav config |\n| Icon System | ✅ Available | lucide-solid + custom icons |\n| Search Button | ✅ In Navbar | Mobile-responsive |\n| Search Logic | ✅ Basic | Searches via cmdk-solid's value prop |\n\n**Potential Enhancement Areas:**\n- Full-text search of page content (not just titles)\n- Search result highlighting/previews\n- Recently visited pages\n- Keyboard navigation hints (⬆️⬇️ to navigate, Enter to select)\n- Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance\n- Grouping enhancements\n- Search history/favorites\n\nLet me know what specific enhancements you'd like to implement!"}],"totalDurationMs":39629,"totalTokens":41529,"totalToolUseCount":24,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4998,"cache_read_input_tokens":34729,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4998,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1795,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.

Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"I need more context first\\\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\\n| \\\"Let me explore the codebase first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## After the Design\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\n- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\n- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d61d4db7-15e5-4516-9754-53182ece5f19","uuid":"cdb33f80-6c76-4510-9cdc-2538dc37273c","isSynthetic":true}

Existing Visualization Components\n\nThe project has ONE canvas-based visualization component:\n\n**Location**: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/ui/live-waveform.tsx`\n\n**Type**: Canvas-based audio waveform visualization\n- Renders live audio frequency data as animated bars\n- Implements ResizeObserver for responsive sizing\n- Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation\n- Canvas context for 2D rendering\n- Supports both \"scrolling\" and \"static\" modes\n- Has gradient caching and fade edge effects\n\n**What this reveals**: The project already has patterns for:\n- Canvas element management and cleanup\n- ResizeObserver for responsive design (line 102-123)\n- Device pixel ratio handling (line 104)\n- Computed style reading (line 410-413)\n- Animation loops with requestAnimationFrame\n\n---\n\n### 3. CSS Theming & Variables System\n\n**Location**: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/app.css`\n\n**CSS Variables Available** (both light and dark themes):\n```css\nColor System:\n--background, --foreground\n--muted, --muted-foreground\n--popover, --popover-foreground\n--border, --input\n--card, --card-foreground\n--primary, --primary-foreground\n--secondary, --secondary-foreground\n--accent, --accent-foreground\n--destructive, --destructive-foreground\n--info, --info-foreground\n--success, --success-foreground\n--warning, --warning-foreground\n--error, --error-foreground\n\nLayout:\n--radius (0.5rem default)\n--ring (primary color)\n\nSidebar-specific:\n--sidebar-background, --sidebar-foreground\n--sidebar-primary, --sidebar-primary-foreground\n--sidebar-accent, --sidebar-accent-foreground\n--sidebar-border, --sidebar-ring\n```\n\n**Dark mode detection**: Uses `[data-kb-theme=\"dark\"]` selector and `.dark` class\n\n**Conclusion**: Excellent theming foundation for charts to consume\n\n---\n\n### 4. Tooltip System\n\n**Location**: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Built on Kobalte Core primitives (`@kobalte/core/tooltip`)\n- Supports portals for proper z-stacking (z-50)\n- Uses Tailwind classes for styling\n- Includes animation: `fade-in-0 zoom-in-95 animate-in`\n- Has configurable `show` prop\n\n**Kobalte Integration**:\n```tsx\n- TooltipPrimitive.Root with gutter={4}\n- TooltipPrimitive.Trigger\n- TooltipPrimitive.Content with Portal\n```\n\n**Perfect for**: Chart tooltips/popovers can build on this pattern\n\n---\n\n### 5. Responsive Sizing Patterns\n\n**ResizeObserver Usage Found**:\n- **File**: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/ui/live-waveform.tsx` (lines 102-123)\n- Updates canvas dimensions on container resize\n- Handles device pixel ratio for crisp rendering\n- Pattern is production-ready and well-tested\n\n**BoundingClientRect Usage**: Line 335 in live-waveform\n\n**Conclusion**: ResizeObserver pattern is already established and can be reused for charts\n\n---\n\n### 6. Utility Functions & Styling\n\n**Location**: `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/lib/utils.ts`\n\n**Available**:\n```typescript\ncn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) - Merges Tailwind classes\n  Uses: clsx + tailwind-merge\n```\n\n**Perfect for**: Dynamic chart styling with Tailwind\n\n---\n\n### 7. Hooks System\n\n**Available Hooks** (`/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/hooks/`):\n\n1. **`use-scrollspy.ts`** - DOM observer pattern\n   - Uses IntersectionObserver\n   - Extracts headings and tracks active section\n   - Pattern: observe elements, track visibility changes\n\n2. **`use-bind-signal.ts`** - Two-way binding\n   - Syncs external and internal signals\n   - Uses `createSignal`, `createEffect`, `on` from solid-js\n   - Pattern: useful for controlled component values\n\n3. **`use-loading.ts`** - Async state with delay\n   - Delay-based state management\n   - Has `.cancel()` method for cleanup\n   - Returns `[isLoading, setIsLoading]` tuple\n\n4. **`use-validated-search-params.ts`** - Search param binding\n   - Uses createEffect to sync URL params\n   - Validates with Zod schemas\n\n**Solid.js Primitives Used**: `createSignal`, `createEffect`, `on`, `createDerived`, `onMount`, `onCleanup`\n\n---\n\n### 8.

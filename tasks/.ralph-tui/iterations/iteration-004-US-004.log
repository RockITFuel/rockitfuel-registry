For all other skills, use the 'Skill' tool:**\\n\\n---\\nname: using-superpowers\\ndescription: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\\n---\\n\\n<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\nIf you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.\\n\\nIF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.

Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"I need more context first\\\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\\n| \\\"Let me explore the codebase first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile a comprehensive report:\n\n## Codebase Analysis: Docs Layout Architecture\n\nBased on my exploration of the rockitfuel-registry codebase, here's a detailed analysis of the current documentation structure and recommendations for implementing a table of contents with scrollspy:\n\n---\n\n### 1. CURRENT DOCS LAYOUT STRUCTURE\n\n**Root Layout:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs.tsx`\n- Creates a responsive grid layout: `md:grid md:grid-cols-[220px_minmax(0,1fr)] lg:grid-cols-[240px_minmax(0,1fr)]`\n- Left column: 220px sidebar (md) / 240px (lg)\n- Right column: Main content area with `py-6 lg:py-8`\n- Includes `DocsPager` component at bottom for prev/next navigation\n- Uses SolidJS Router's `FileRoutes` for automatic routing\n\n**Layout Components Involved:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app).tsx` - App wrapper with Navbar and Toaster\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/navbar.tsx` - Sticky top navigation (h-14, z-50)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/sidebar.tsx` - Collapsible sidebar with persistent state\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/docs-pager.tsx` - Bottom pagination\n\n---\n\n### 2. SIDEBAR IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/sidebar.tsx`\n\nKey features:\n- **Persistent State**: Uses `@solid-primitives/storage` with `makePersisted` to save expanded sections in localStorage\n- **State Management**: Stores expanded/collapsed state per section in key `\"sidebar-sections-expanded\"`\n- **Configuration-Driven**: Reads from `docsConfig.sidebarNav` (centralized config)\n- **Responsive**: Hidden on mobile (`md:hidden`), sticky on larger screens\n- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind with `md:sticky`, `border-right`, scrollable with `overflow-y-auto`\n- **Icons**: Uses `IconChevronRight` from lucide-solid with rotation animation on expand\n\n**Config Structure** (`/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`):\n```typescript\ntype NavCategory = { title: string; items: NavElement[] }\ntype NavElement = { title: string; href: string; external?: boolean; status?: \"new\" | \"updated\" }\n```\n\nCategories include:\n- Getting Started\n- UI Components (29 items)\n- Blocks (3 items)\n- Libraries (3 items)\n- Hooks (3 items)\n\n---\n\n### 3. CONTENT PAGE STRUCTURE\n\n**Pattern 1 - Simple Pages** (e.g., `getting-started.tsx`):\n- Multiple `<section>` elements with `<h2>` headings\n- Classes: `space-y-8` wrapper, `font-semibold text-2xl` for h2\n- Content wrapped in semantic `<section>` tags\n- Imports `PageHeader`, `PageHeaderHeading`, `PageHeaderDescription`\n\n**Pattern 2 - Component Pages** (e.g., `button.tsx`):\n- Uses `ComponentPage` wrapper component\n- Structured sections: Installation, Dependencies, Preview\n\n**Pattern 3 - Library Pages** (e.g., `gatehouse.tsx`):\n- Complex multi-section layouts with h2 headings (Installation, Features, Interactive Demo, Basic Usage, Credits)\n- Can contain 5-8+ sections with various content types\n- Line length: ~120 lines for complex pages\n\n**Example Content Structure:**\n```tsx\n<div class=\"space-y-8\">\n  <section>\n    <h2 class=\"mb-4 font-semibold text-xl\">Installation</h2>\n    <InstallCommand component=\"...\" />\n  </section>\n  <section>\n    <h2 class=\"mb-4 font-semibold text-xl\">Features</h2>\n    <ul>...</ul>\n  </section>\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. FRAMEWORK & DEPENDENCIES\n\n**Framework Stack:**\n- **SolidJS** 1.9.5 - Reactive framework\n- **SolidJS Router** 0.15.3 - File-based routing\n- **@solidjs/start** 1.2.0 - Meta framework\n- **Vinxi** 0.5.3 - Build tool\n- **Tailwind CSS** 3.4.17 - Styling\n- **Kobalte** (@kobalte/core 0.13.11) - Accessible component primitives\n- **Class Variance Authority** (CVA) - Component variant management\n- **Shiki** 3.21.0 - Syntax highlighting\n- **Lucide Solid** 0.544.0 - Icon library\n- **Solid Primitives** - Collection of SolidJS utilities\n\n**Key CSS Setup:**\n- Dark mode: `darkMode: [\"class\"]` (Tailwind config)\n- Responsive breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl\n- CSS Variables for theming (--primary, --accent, --muted, etc.)\n- Custom animations for accordion/collapsible elements\n\n---\n\n### 5. UI COMPONENTS AVAILABLE\n\n**Sidebar-Related:**\n- `/src/components/app-sidebar/` - 12 composable sidebar components (provider, container, content, header, footer, trigger, button, user, screen-content, screen-header, separator)\n\n**Documentation:**\n- `PageHeader` with `PageHeaderHeading`, `PageHeaderDescription`, `PageHeaderActions`\n- `DocsPager` - Previous/Next navigation\n- `CopyPageUrlButton` - Copy current page URL to clipboard\n- `InstallCommand` - Display installation commands\n- `CodeBlock` - Syntax-highlighted code with copy button\n\n**UI Primitives:**\n- Collapsible, Tabs, Sheet, Popover, Hover Card\n- Badge, Button, Card, Separator\n- Alert, Callout\n\n**Styling Utilities:**\n- `cn()` function from `/src/lib/utils.ts` - Combines clsx + tailwind-merge\n- Consistent use of Tailwind utility classes throughout\n\n---\n\n### 6. EXISTING PATTERNS FOR SCROLLSPY IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**What's Already in Place:**\n\n1. **Reactive State Management** - SolidJS signals and stores can track scroll position\n2. **Effect System** - `createEffect()` and `onMount()` for lifecycle management (used in image-preview-dialog.tsx, badge-delta.tsx, live-waveform.tsx)\n3. **Intersection Observer Pattern** - No current usage, but can be implemented with SolidJS primitives\n4. **Persistent Storage** - `@solid-primitives/storage` already in use for sidebar state\n5. **Responsive Layout** - Grid system with fixed sidebar allows for right TOC placement\n6. **Icons** - Table of Contents icon available in lucide-solid\n\n---\n\n### 7. ARCHITECTURE FOR TABLE OF CONTENTS WITH SCROLLSPY\n\n**Recommended Implementation Approach:**\n\n**A) New Component Structure:**\n```\nsrc/components/\n  ├── table-of-contents.tsx (Main TOC component)\n  ├── toc-item.tsx (Individual TOC link)\n  └── use-scrollspy.ts (Custom hook for tracking headings)\n```\n\n**B) Scrollspy Hook Pattern** (Following existing SolidJS patterns):\n```typescript\n// Track headings and current active section using IntersectionObserver\n// Store: signal indicating active heading ID\n// Effect: IntersectionObserver watching all h2/h3 elements\n```\n\n**C) Layout Modification Options:**\n\n**Option 1 - Three Column (Optimal):**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│              Navbar (sticky)                 │\n├────────┬───────────────────────┬────────────┤\n│Sidebar │  Main Content (700px) │ TOC (250px)│\n│ 240px  │                       │            │\n│        │                       │            │\n└────────┴───────────────────────┴────────────┘\n```\n\nAdd to docs.tsx grid: `lg:grid-cols-[240px_minmax(0,1fr)_240px]`\n\n**Option 2 - Right Sidebar Only (Fits Current Layout):**\nTOC positioned at `lg:` breakpoint only, stays with right panel\nModify: `md:grid md:grid-cols-[220px_minmax(0,1fr)] lg:grid-cols-[220px_minmax(0,1fr)_250px]`\n\n**Option 3 - Floating (Non-intrusive):**\nPosition absolute/fixed on right edge with overflow detection\nNo layout changes needed\n\n---\n\n### 8. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**File Paths & Structure:**\n\n1. **Config Extension** - Extend `docsConfig.ts` to include TOC metadata if needed (optional)\n\n2. **New Components:**\n   - TOC component with auto-discovery of h2/h3 headings in article\n   - Scrollspy hook using IntersectionObserver API\n\n3. **Hook System:**\n   - `useScrollspy()` - Track current scroll position and active heading\n   - Leverage SolidJS lifecycle: `onMount`, `createEffect`, `createSignal`\n\n4. **Styling:**\n   - Use existing Tailwind utilities\n   - Position in right panel or fixed overlay\n   - Responsive hiding on mobile/tablet (show only on lg+)\n   - Match existing sidebar styling patterns\n\n5. **Integration Points:**\n   - Modify `/src/routes/(app)/docs.tsx` layout grid\n   - Add TOC component as new grid column\n   - TOC auto-extracts headings from `<article>` element\n\n---\n\n### 9. TECHNICAL PATTERNS TO FOLLOW\n\n**From Existing Code:**\n\n1. **Persistent State** (like sidebar):\n   ```typescript\n   const [expandedSections, setExpandedSections] = isServer\n     ? [baseStore, setBaseStore]\n     : makePersisted(createStore<ExpandedSections>({}), {\n         name: \"toc-expanded-sections\",\n       });\n   ```\n\n2. **Responsive Visibility**:\n   ```tsx\n   <aside class=\"hidden lg:block lg:w-[240px]\">\n   ```\n\n3. **Sticky Positioning**:\n   ```tsx\n   <div class=\"sticky top-[3.5rem] max-h-[calc(100vh-3.5rem)] overflow-y-auto\">\n   ```\n\n4. **Icons from Lucide**:\n   ```typescript\n   import { IconTableOfContents } from \"lucide-solid\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Classname Utilities**:\n   ```typescript\n   import { cn } from \"~/lib/utils\"\n   class={cn(\"base-styles\", conditional && \"conditional-styles\")}\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### 10.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile a comprehensive report:\n\n## Codebase Analysis: Docs Layout Architecture\n\nBased on my exploration of the rockitfuel-registry codebase, here's a detailed analysis of the current documentation structure and recommendations for implementing a table of contents with scrollspy:\n\n---\n\n### 1. CURRENT DOCS LAYOUT STRUCTURE\n\n**Root Layout:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app)/docs.tsx`\n- Creates a responsive grid layout: `md:grid md:grid-cols-[220px_minmax(0,1fr)] lg:grid-cols-[240px_minmax(0,1fr)]`\n- Left column: 220px sidebar (md) / 240px (lg)\n- Right column: Main content area with `py-6 lg:py-8`\n- Includes `DocsPager` component at bottom for prev/next navigation\n- Uses SolidJS Router's `FileRoutes` for automatic routing\n\n**Layout Components Involved:**\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/routes/(app).tsx` - App wrapper with Navbar and Toaster\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/navbar.tsx` - Sticky top navigation (h-14, z-50)\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/sidebar.tsx` - Collapsible sidebar with persistent state\n- `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/docs-pager.tsx` - Bottom pagination\n\n---\n\n### 2. SIDEBAR IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**File:** `/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/components/sidebar.tsx`\n\nKey features:\n- **Persistent State**: Uses `@solid-primitives/storage` with `makePersisted` to save expanded sections in localStorage\n- **State Management**: Stores expanded/collapsed state per section in key `\"sidebar-sections-expanded\"`\n- **Configuration-Driven**: Reads from `docsConfig.sidebarNav` (centralized config)\n- **Responsive**: Hidden on mobile (`md:hidden`), sticky on larger screens\n- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind with `md:sticky`, `border-right`, scrollable with `overflow-y-auto`\n- **Icons**: Uses `IconChevronRight` from lucide-solid with rotation animation on expand\n\n**Config Structure** (`/home/luka/projects/rockitfuel-registry/src/config/docs.ts`):\n```typescript\ntype NavCategory = { title: string; items: NavElement[] }\ntype NavElement = { title: string; href: string; external?: boolean; status?: \"new\" | \"updated\" }\n```\n\nCategories include:\n- Getting Started\n- UI Components (29 items)\n- Blocks (3 items)\n- Libraries (3 items)\n- Hooks (3 items)\n\n---\n\n### 3. CONTENT PAGE STRUCTURE\n\n**Pattern 1 - Simple Pages** (e.g., `getting-started.tsx`):\n- Multiple `<section>` elements with `<h2>` headings\n- Classes: `space-y-8` wrapper, `font-semibold text-2xl` for h2\n- Content wrapped in semantic `<section>` tags\n- Imports `PageHeader`, `PageHeaderHeading`, `PageHeaderDescription`\n\n**Pattern 2 - Component Pages** (e.g., `button.tsx`):\n- Uses `ComponentPage` wrapper component\n- Structured sections: Installation, Dependencies, Preview\n\n**Pattern 3 - Library Pages** (e.g., `gatehouse.tsx`):\n- Complex multi-section layouts with h2 headings (Installation, Features, Interactive Demo, Basic Usage, Credits)\n- Can contain 5-8+ sections with various content types\n- Line length: ~120 lines for complex pages\n\n**Example Content Structure:**\n```tsx\n<div class=\"space-y-8\">\n  <section>\n    <h2 class=\"mb-4 font-semibold text-xl\">Installation</h2>\n    <InstallCommand component=\"...\" />\n  </section>\n  <section>\n    <h2 class=\"mb-4 font-semibold text-xl\">Features</h2>\n    <ul>...</ul>\n  </section>\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. FRAMEWORK & DEPENDENCIES\n\n**Framework Stack:**\n- **SolidJS** 1.9.5 - Reactive framework\n- **SolidJS Router** 0.15.3 - File-based routing\n- **@solidjs/start** 1.2.0 - Meta framework\n- **Vinxi** 0.5.3 - Build tool\n- **Tailwind CSS** 3.4.17 - Styling\n- **Kobalte** (@kobalte/core 0.13.11) - Accessible component primitives\n- **Class Variance Authority** (CVA) - Component variant management\n- **Shiki** 3.21.0 - Syntax highlighting\n- **Lucide Solid** 0.544.0 - Icon library\n- **Solid Primitives** - Collection of SolidJS utilities\n\n**Key CSS Setup:**\n- Dark mode: `darkMode: [\"class\"]` (Tailwind config)\n- Responsive breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl\n- CSS Variables for theming (--primary, --accent, --muted, etc.)\n- Custom animations for accordion/collapsible elements\n\n---\n\n### 5. UI COMPONENTS AVAILABLE\n\n**Sidebar-Related:**\n- `/src/components/app-sidebar/` - 12 composable sidebar components (provider, container, content, header, footer, trigger, button, user, screen-content, screen-header, separator)\n\n**Documentation:**\n- `PageHeader` with `PageHeaderHeading`, `PageHeaderDescription`, `PageHeaderActions`\n- `DocsPager` - Previous/Next navigation\n- `CopyPageUrlButton` - Copy current page URL to clipboard\n- `InstallCommand` - Display installation commands\n- `CodeBlock` - Syntax-highlighted code with copy button\n\n**UI Primitives:**\n- Collapsible, Tabs, Sheet, Popover, Hover Card\n- Badge, Button, Card, Separator\n- Alert, Callout\n\n**Styling Utilities:**\n- `cn()` function from `/src/lib/utils.ts` - Combines clsx + tailwind-merge\n- Consistent use of Tailwind utility classes throughout\n\n---\n\n### 6.
